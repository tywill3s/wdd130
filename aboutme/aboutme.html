<h2>Tyler Willes</h2>
<p>Hello, everyone. This is my first year at BYU-Idaho after transferring from 
    UVU. My major will be Professional Studies because there are a few certificates
    that I think will be more valuable for me.
</p>
<p>I really enjoy sports of all kinds. I'm also a 3D printing / CNC hobbyist.</p>
<p>I am married to the beautiful lady in the picture above. We have been married for 2 years now.
    We don't have any children yet, but we have a beautiful australian shepherd named Sunny.
</p>
<p>I currently work for a SaaS company as a Sales Rep. It is a nice job while going to school,
    but it doesn't excite me as much as other career paths might. I hope that my education will 
    open some doors to find careers more tailored to creating and innovating.
</p>
<p>I was born into the Church and I served my mission in Recife, Brazil.
